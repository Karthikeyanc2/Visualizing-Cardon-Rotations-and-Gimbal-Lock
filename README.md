# Visualizing-Euler-Rotations-and-Gimbal-Lock
Interactive Visualization of Euler angle rotation in different sequences along with translation

Note 1 : This model works only for euler rotation and not for Cardon rotations

Note 2 : Translations must be done first before rotations

Use '+' and '-' buttons for translating and rotating w.r.t different axeses

Use 'makecopy' button to keep a history of cordinate systems.

Gimbal lock can be visualized by adding second rotation to 90 degrees.
